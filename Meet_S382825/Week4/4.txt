  2. Create a web API with ASP.NET Core controllers
	- REST: A common pattern for building APIs with HTTP
	- Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for building web services. REST requests are made -over HTTP. They use the same HTTP verbs that web browsers use to retrieve webpages and send data to servers. The verbs are:
	GET: Retrieve data from the web service.
	POST: Create a new item of data on the web service.
	PUT: Update an item of data on the web service.
	PATCH: Update an item of data on the web service by describing a set of instructions about how the item should be modified. The sample application in this module doesn't use this verb.
  DELETE: Delete an item of data on the web service.
